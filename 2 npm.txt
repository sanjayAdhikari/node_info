What is NPM:
============


npm in a nutshell:
=================

  * npm is a pacakage manager for node.js apps.
  * similar to 'mavem' for Java and "composer" for PHP applications.
  * There are two primary interfaces you will interact with - the NPM website and the NPM command line toolkit.
  * npm comes bundled with Node.js, so no need to install it separately.


  npm website:
  =============

    https://npmjs.com/

  CLI:
  ===

  npm


  Adding Dependencies:
  ===================


  * Add runtime dependencies to your application.
  * npm install lodash --save
  * The module gets saved in package.json
  * lodash is installed and placed in node_modules folder.
  * No need to add package.json in Version control,if you are using git make sure to add it to the .gitignore file.

    dependencies:{
    'lodash': '8.9.1'
    }


    Adding development dependencies:
    ===============================

      * npm install mocha --save-dev
      * Once you do that, a new section will appear in your package.json file called devDependencies.


     npm cripts:
     ===========

     * npm scripts is a very powerful concept.
     * With the help of them you can build small utilities or even compose complex build systems.
     * the most common are start and test.
     * "start" helps you to describe how to start your application. Very useful in PaaS platform which reads the package.json files.
     * "test" is for runnig tests.

     "scripts": {
      "start": "node index.js",
      "test": "mocha test",
      "your-custom-script": "echo npm"
    }

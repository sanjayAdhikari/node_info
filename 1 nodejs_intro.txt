What is Node.js:
===============

  * Node.js is an open source framework.
  * It is a cross-platform JS runtime environment built on Chrome's v8 Engine.
  * It is used to develop server side and networking applications.
  * It uses a event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient.
  * It uses libUV, a multi-platform support libraray for async IO.

    Write servers using JS
    -----------------------

   From Dev's point-of-view, Node.js is single threaded.

   But under the hood, libUV handles all the threading,file system events, implements the event loop, thread pooling.


   Why use Node.js:
   ================

    * Node.js enables dev's to use JS on both front and backend.
    * Perfect tool for developing high "throughput" server-side applications.
    * Scales flawlessly, thereby reducing infrastructure costs.
    * Open source technology has dynamic tools and modules(npm).


    Installing Node.js:
    ===================

    Either from offical website or using "nvm"

    It comes really handy when you want to deploy your application to a PaaS provider - they can recognize it and start your application using that.

    node --version
    nvm install 8.9.1
    nvm use 8.9.1
    nvm uninstall 8.9.1
